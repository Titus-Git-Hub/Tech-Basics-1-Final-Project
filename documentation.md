**DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**

After coming up with the idea of creating a “hunter vs. hunted” game, I first started working on the game field. 
I took inspiration from the well-known game Pac-Man. 

With the knowledge I had gained in class, I was able to implement the barriers. At the beginning, I determined the size of the game window 
and did the necessary calculations. A sketch of the field that I had prepared beforehand helped me a lot - not only to set a clear goal from the start 
but also as a reference during development, allowing me to assign and adjust barriers more easily.
Since at the beginning I still wanted to design my game in the style of Pac-Man, my first sketch was a little different from the final result...

In fact, it also wasn’t originally planned that some of the gaps would be smaller than others, making it harder to get through, but I saw it as 
a good challenge to keep this feature in the game.

Once the field was finished, I moved on to creating the classes for the game characters. Since I wanted to keep the project within my possibilities 
and without relying too much on AI, I only needed two classes: one for the hunter and one for the hunted.

Next, I focused on improving the user experience. I didn’t want the game to start right after running the code. Instead, I decided to work 
with multiple screens: a start screen, a pause screen, an end screen, and of course the main game. 
At first, I wasn’t sure how to implement this, so I did some research and then applied the solution to all three scenarios.

As a finishing touch, I added music to make the atmosphere more immersive. I chose a consistent soundtrack for the menu screens that fit the situation, added a 
countdown feature with sound effects to increase the tension, and finally included a separate, mysterious and suspenseful soundtrack for the game itself. 

I believe the game still has potential for further development; for example, adding different levels or difficulty modes. However, I didn’t see it as 
the main purpose of this assignment to rely fully on ChatGPT or AI in general. While AI did support me at certain points, I made sure to work independently as much as possible.

Looking back, I am very happy with what I was able to build, achieve, and especially learn in Python during this time. Even if I didn’t always know the code by heart, 
I understood why things worked the way they did. The process was a mix of trying things out myself, adapting code from older projects, and, when necessary, asking AI for help.

For me, the project achieved exactly what I wanted: not losing interest in coding due to feeling overwhelmed, but instead learning new things, improving my skills, 
and staying curious and open to future challenges.
